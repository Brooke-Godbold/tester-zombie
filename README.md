# Tester Zombie

A Mock Server App which can generate responses on the Server, and can be updated via a Front-End at runtime

---

## 🛠 Installation

To install, run the following

```bash
npm install
```

To start, run the following

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server responses are not regenerated by default, to regenerate them, run the following before the previous command

```bash
npm run build
```

A .env file is required to be placed within the /server folder

```bash
.env

PORT=3000
BASE_API=COMMON_PREFIX_FOR_ALL_API
```

---

## 🛠 Usage -> Back-End

Responses must be contained within the Response folder in the Server. Each endpoint must have a Config file, and a Response file

```bash
NAME.config.json
{
  "endpoint": "/endpoint",
  "method": "METHOD_IN_CAPITALS",
  "statusCode": 200
}
```

```bash
NAME.response.json
{
  "field": "value"
  ...
}
```

Response folders may also contain an optional generate file. If present, this must contain a generate() function, which will be run when the App starts, and this should place a response file into the same folder in the format as above

```bash
NAME.generate.ts

export async function generate() {}
```

---

## 🛠 Usage -> Front-End

The Front-End will display a list of all endpoints contained within the Response folder

These responses, along with status codes, can be edited in the Front-End, and updated as desired

Changes to the responses will persist as long as the 'npm run build' command is not run

If the build command is run again, the responses will be overwritten with the base server responses once more
